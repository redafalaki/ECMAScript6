        Arrow functions can make the code more readable pluse make the use of "this" keyword,
        It helps us to deal with the scope of "this" keyword.

        Let's take the same example of the object "employee" that we built before
        and modify (simplify) it for the purpose of this topic:

                    Problem:

                    - "name" using "this" keyword that refers to this object's name property => Alex Chow
