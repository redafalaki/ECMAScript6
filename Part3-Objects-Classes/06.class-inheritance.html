            Class Inheritance:
            Creating a class that can take all the members (properties, methods) from its parent class.
            This process is called "Extending The Class" which can be done by taking the parent/superclass
            and extend it by customizing it for a specific type of object with the child/subclass

        class Person {
            /*
            NOTE:
            We can declare the class properties before using them inside the constructor:
            Below we are declaring a property called "name", then assign a value to it: this.name = 
            Please remember it's an optional step so the name; declaration is optional.

            If you omit this optional step, the code line => this.name = name; 
            in the constructor will create the name property before initializing it. 
            However, listing properties explicitly in the class declaration 
            might make it easier for people reading your code to see which properties are part of this class.
